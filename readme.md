1.The website is a Search Engine Optimization Firms homepage
<br>
2. The website gives information to clients about the services offered
<br>
3. The website is accessible with alt="" image tags to help users/browsers understand that most of the imgages are not pertinent to the content but are stock images.

Here were the requirements and reasoning why each were coded the way they were:

Requirement 1.
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements


Notes: Added <header> <footer> <article> and <nav> section – updated CSS style sheet accordingly


Requirement 2. 
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

Notes: Changed out HTML elements and updated CSS styling accordingly

Requirement 3- 
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

Notes: Added alt= “” to all images to show that they have no meaning to the page as they aren’t an actual picture of something. 

But added descriptions to social media marketing, etc.

Fixed jump to anchor text for “search-engine-optimization.”


Requirement 4
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

Notes: Not seeing any issues with this they all follow an H1, H2, H3 order


Requirement 5

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Notes: Changed to Hiriseon – Search Engine Optimization Marketing (under 60 characters.)
